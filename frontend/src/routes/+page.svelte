	<h1>Social Habits</h1>
	<br />
	<h2>Why?</h2>
	<br />
	<p>
		This project is heavily inspired by the printable habit trackers. I find it very powerful to be
		able to see your habits in a single frame and all your successes and failures along the way.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another key factor in building habits is to have good people by your side, always wishing you
		the best. That's why this project is social at its core, you can share and talk about your
		habits with your friends and family.
